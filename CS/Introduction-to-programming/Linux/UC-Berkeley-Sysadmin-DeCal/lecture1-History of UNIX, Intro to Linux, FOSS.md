# inrto to the shell

- **What is the shell?** A command line-interface (CLI) to interact with the computer.
- Common shells: bash, zsh, fish
    - They’re mostly the same, (bash will be supported by almost all UNIX systems though).

- Shell Commands
    - Basic structure of a command is `[command] [flags] [arguments]` 
    - RTFM! `man [command]`
    -  Google is also your best friend

## Common Shell Commands

- ssh: `ssh user@ip`
- `cd` - change directory
- `ls` - list directory
- `cat` - concatenate and print files
- `head` - read the first 10 lines
- `less` - read larger files
- `mv` - move
- `cp` - copy
- `rm` - delete a file 

## Editors

- Nano
- Vim (`vimtutor`)
- Emacs (Emacs Tutorial)
- Try running `(editor of choice) (file)`
- Try searching “vi” or “emacs” on google



Open Source Software (OSS)

- **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** **or** **Free/Libre Open Source Software (F/LOSS)**
- “Free as in beer, and free as in freedom”
- **Open source software** - term used by some software and technology companies. You may not have the right to use, modify, or redistribute the software or source code.

Berkeley Standard Distribution

- A UNIX derivative (BSD) was created at UC Berkeley
- Popular and reliable, a lot of things from BSD are used today 
    - vi and Berkeley sockets
- Stuck in legal limbo w/ AT&T 
- BSD derivatives still remain popular (MacOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD)

Unix’s advantages over non-Unix systems

- UNIX philosophy: simple, short, clear, and modular code
- UNIX idea: “everything is a file”
- Worse is better.
- Sockets for networking, now copied beyond Unix systems
- “It’s very simple — you read the protocol and write the code.” - Bill Joy on implementing TCP/IP

OSS Licenses: Legal Jiggery-Pokery

- Copyleft (GPL)
    - “I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free.” - Stallman (GNU Manifesto)
    - “a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches” - Steve Ballmer
- Permissive (MIT, BSD, Apache, WTFPL)
